# Howbout... a game of Snake?

## Challenge
Snake should e implemented in HTML, JavaScript and CSS based on the partial implementation provided. Complete the creation of the game and implement the High Scores feature.

The project plan can be found at [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md)
## Rules
- Must only be completed using raw JavaScript, HTML and CSS with no external libraries
- Must work in the latest version of Google Chrome
- Try not to change existing source code
- HTTP requests use JSON
- User controls snake around game board
- Snake is in continuous motion and can change direction using arrow keys
- Eating an apple will increase the user's score, length and speed
- Eating an apple will generate a new apple
- If the snake hits its own tail, or the edge of the board, the game is over
## Usage
### User
- The game can be played at https://chrismott97.github.io/howbout-snake/snake.html .
- Arrow keys, WASD or touch screen controls can be used to control the snake.
- Collecting friends or occasions gives 1 point, adds to the snake length, and speeds up the snake.
- Collecting the ðŸ¤ª will change all friends to add 3 points but no extra speed or length. Directions will be reversed. This will last until 3 new people are collected.
### Developer
- Tests can be run at https://chrismott97.github.io/howbout-snake/snake.html?test and results can be viewed in the developer console.
- Development environment can be run by opening `snake.html` or by running `docker compose up` in the correct directory, should Docker be used. **Docker is recommended as it is more similar to a production environment.**
